var r1Body = "This project spanned the entirety of the semester, and required us to present a few topics we learned in class, plus a task of our choice. We worked with a Yahboom Dofbot Jetson Nano, programming with Yahboom's Python API in JupyterLab. I did the programming for our group, working with OpenCV and NumPy to implement forward and inverse kinematics, path following, and our choice task."
